# Brassica Rapeseed and Vegetable Optimisation (BRAVO)

Brassica species encompass a diverse range of economically important crop species worth in excess of $20 billion worldwide.

The UK oilseed rape and Brassica vegetable markets alone are worth in excess of Â£1B/annum.

Losses in these crops can exceed 20% and are heavily influenced by unfavourable weather patterns.
As such, adapting them to buffer against climate variables represents a complex challenge for agriculture.
The BRAVO Project is in a unique position to help.

Our research goal is to better understand seasonal and environmental effects on developmental transitions in Brassica crops, 
and to use this information to improve reliability, yield and quality.

BRAVO aims to unravel the gene networks controlling flowering time in response to environmental cues and study how these networks 
affect all developmental stages of the plant, from vegetative growth to seed production. 
This whole life-cycle approach differs from previous studies providing insights into the knock-on effects of changes to genes and network 
for the whole plant allowing us to gain a better understanding of how to incorporate changes which are optimal for the crop plant as a whole. 
This will allow future development of robust, high yielding plants.
